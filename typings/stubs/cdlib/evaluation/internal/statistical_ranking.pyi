def friedman_test(*args: dict) -> [float, float, list, list]:
    """
    Performs a Friedman ranking test.
    Tests the hypothesis that in a set of k dependent samples groups (where k >= 2) at least two of the groups represent populations with different median values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1, sample2, ... : array_like
        The sample measurements for each group.

    Returns
    -------
    F-value : float
        The computed F-value of the test.
    p-value : float
        The associated p-value from the F-distribution.
    rankings : array_like
        The ranking for each group.
    pivots : array_like
        The pivotal quantities for each group.

def bonferroni_dunn_test(ranks: dict, control: str = ...) -> [list, list, list, list]:
    """
    Performs a Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc test using the pivot quantities obtained by a ranking test.
    Tests the hypothesis that the ranking of the control method is different to each of the other methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ranks : dictionary_like
        A dictionary with format 'groupname':'pivotal quantity'
    control : string optional
        The name of the control method (one vs all), default None (all vs all)

    Returns
    ----------
    comparisons : array-like
        Strings identifier of each comparison with format 'group_i vs group_j'
    Z-values : array-like
        The computed Z-value statistic for each comparison.
    p-values : array-like
        The associated p-value from the Z-distribution which depends on the index of the comparison
    Adjusted p-values : array-like
        The associated adjusted p-values which can be compared with a significance level
