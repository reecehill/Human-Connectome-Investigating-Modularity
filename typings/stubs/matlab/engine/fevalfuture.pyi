"""
FevalFuture: The class name of a future result returned by the MATLAB Engine.

An instance of FevalFuture is returned from each asynchronous invocation of a
MATLAB statement or function.  The future result serves as a placeholder of the
actual result, so the future result can be returned immediately.  MATLAB puts
the actual result into the placeholder when the MATLAB function finishes its
evaluation.  The future result can be used to interrupt the execution, check the
completion status, and get the result of a MATLAB statement.

    A FevalFuture object is used to hold the future result of a MATLAB
    statement.  The FevalFuture object should be only created by MatlabEngine
    after submitting a MATLAB command for evaluation.
