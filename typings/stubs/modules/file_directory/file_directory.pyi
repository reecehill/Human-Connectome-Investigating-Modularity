    createDirectory verifies if a (sub-)directory exists, and creates it (with/without parents) if not. 

    Args:
        directoryPath (list[str]): A list of paths to folders to be created.
        createParents (bool): If createParents is false (the default), a missing parent raises FileNotFoundError. If createParents is true, any missing parents of this path are created as needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking mode into account. 
        throwErrorIfExists (bool): If throwErrorIfExists is true (the default), FileExistsError is raised if the target directory already exists.

    Returns:

        None: Does not return anything.
