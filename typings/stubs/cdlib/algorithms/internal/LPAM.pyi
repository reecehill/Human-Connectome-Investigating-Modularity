    Link Partitioning Around Medoids

    :param graph: a networkx object
    :param k: number of clusters
    :param threshold: merging threshold in [0,1], default 0.5
    :param distance: type of distance: "amp" - amplified commute distance, or
    "cm" - commute distance, or distance matrix between all edges as np ndarray
    :param seed: random seed for k-medoid heuristic

    :return: NodeClustering object

    :Example:

    >>> from cdlib import algorithms
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
    >>> coms = algorithms.lpam(G, k=2, threshold=0.4, distance = "amp")
