# Read me
This repo is part of a dissertation project at the University of Nottingham, under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Kaiser. 

# Dataset
The "Participants" folder is populated with MRI data provided by the Human Connectome Project. They are not included in this repo and must be downloaded.

# Changes
The original code scripts were provided and used by Taylor et al. (2017). Changes have since been made.

At the time of writing the HCP dataset is undergoing maintenance and is therefore only available on the AWS. Perhaps as a result, the folder hierarchy is different to that proposed by Taylor et al. Most changes correct filepaths to accommodate this.
