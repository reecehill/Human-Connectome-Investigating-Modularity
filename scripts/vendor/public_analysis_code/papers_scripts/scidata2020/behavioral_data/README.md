## Notes about scripts for behavioral-data analysis

Author: Ana Luisa Pinho

These scripts parse and analyse individual behavioral data extracted from `.xpd` files generated by the protocols _mtt_ and _self_, `.mat` files generated by the protocol _tom_ and `.dat` files generated by the protocols _vstm_ and _enumeration_.

These protocols can be found in the repository on GitHub dedicated to the IBC behavioral protocols: https://github.com/hbp-brain-charting/public_protocols
