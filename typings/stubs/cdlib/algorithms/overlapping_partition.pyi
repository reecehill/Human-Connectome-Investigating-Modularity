    IPCA was introduced by Li et al. (2008) as a modiﬁed version of DPClus.
    In contrast to DPClus, this method focuses on the maintaining the diameter of a cluster, deﬁned as the maximum shortest distance between all pairs of vertices, rather than its density.
    In doing so, the seed growth aspect of IPCA emphasizes structural closeness of a predicted protein complex, as well as structural connectivity.

    Like DPClus, IPCA computes local vertex and edge weights by counting the number of common neighbors shared between two vertices.
    However, IPCA calculates these values only once at the beginning of the algorithm, rather than updating them every time a discovered cluster is removed from the graph.
    This allows overlap to occur naturally between clusters, as cluster nodes are not permanently removed from the graph; however, it can also lead to a large amount of cluster overlap.

    The motivation behind the core-attachment (CoAch) algorithm  comes from the observation that protein complexes often have a dense core of highly interactive proteins.
    CoAch works in two steps, ﬁrst discovering highly connected regions (“preliminary cores”) of a network and then expanding these regions by adding strongly associated neighbors.

    The algorithm operates with three user-speciﬁed parameters: minimum core density (for preliminary cores), maximum core affinity (similarity threshold for distinct preliminary cores), and minimum neighbor closeness (for attaching non-core neighbors to preliminary cores).

    This method takes advantage of the use of entropy with regard to information theory.
    Entropy is a measure of uncertainty involved in a random variable.

    This approach uses a new deﬁnition, Graph Entropy, as a measure of structural complexity in a graph.
    This algorithm incorporates a seed-growth technique.
    Unlike the other seed-growth style methods, however, the graph entropy approach does not require any predetermined threshold because it searches for an optimal solution by minimizing graph entropy.

    This method ﬁnds locally optimal clusters with minimal graph entropy.
    A seed vertex is selected at random from a candidate set of seed vertices.
    Then, an initial cluster which is composed of the seed vertex and its immediate neighbors is created.
    Next, the neighbors are iteratively evaluated for removal to minimize the initial entropy of the graph.
    Finally, outer boundary vertices are added recursively if their addition causes the entropy of the graph to decrease.
