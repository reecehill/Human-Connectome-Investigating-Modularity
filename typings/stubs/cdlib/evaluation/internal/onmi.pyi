    Compute Overlapping NMI

    This implementation allows to compute 3 versions of the overlapping NMI
    LFK: The original implementation proposed by Lacichinetti et al.(1). The normalization of mutual information is done community by community
    MGH: In (2), McDaid et al. argued that the original NMI normalization was flawed and introduced a new (global) normalization by the max of entropy
    MGH_LFK: This is a variant of the LFK method introduced in (2), with the same type of normalization but done globally instead of at each community

    Results are checked to be similar to the C++ implementations by the authors of (2): https://github.com/aaronmcdaid/Overlapping-NMI
