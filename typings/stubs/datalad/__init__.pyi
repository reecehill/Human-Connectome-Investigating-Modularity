"""DataLad aims to expose (scientific) data available online as a unified data
distribution with the convenience of git-annex repositories as a backend.

Commands are exposed through both a command-line interface and a Python API. On
the command line, run 'datalad --help' for a summary of the available commands.
From an interactive Python session, import `datalad.api` and inspect its
documentation with `help`.
