    Parameters
    ==========
    ds : Dataset
      All results have to be concerning this single dataset (used to resolve
      relpaths).
    requested_paths : list
      List of path arguments sent to `git annex`

    dir_fail_msg : str
      Message template to inject into the result for a requested directory where
      a failure was reported for some of its content. The template contains two
      string placeholders that will be expanded with 1) the path of the
      directory, and 2) the content failure paths for that directory
    noinfo_dir_msg : str
      Message template to inject into the result for a requested directory that
      `git annex` was silent about (incl. any content). There must be one string
      placeholder that is expanded with the path of that directory.
    noinfo_file_msg : str
      Message to inject into the result for a requested file that `git
      annex` was silent about.
    noinfo_status : str
      Status to report when annex provides no information
    **kwargs
      Any further kwargs are included in the yielded result dictionary.
