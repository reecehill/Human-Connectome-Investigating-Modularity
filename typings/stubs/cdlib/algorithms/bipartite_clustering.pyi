    BiMLPA is designed to detect the many-to-many correspondence community in bipartite networks using multi-label propagation algorithm.

    This method works for the connected graph. If the graph is not connected, the method will be applied to each connected component of the graph and the results will be merged.

    Infomap is based on ideas of information theory.
    The algorithm uses the probability flow of random walks on a bipartite network as a proxy for information flows in the real system and it decomposes the network into modules by compressing a description of the probability flow.
