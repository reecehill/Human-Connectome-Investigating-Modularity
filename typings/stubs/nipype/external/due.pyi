"""

Stub file for a guaranteed safe import of duecredit constructs:  if duecredit
is not available.

To use it, place it into your project codebase to be imported, e.g. copy as

    cp stub.py /path/tomodule/module/due.py

Note that it might be better to avoid naming it duecredit.py to avoid shadowing
installed duecredit.

Then use in your code as

    from .due import due, Doi, BibTeX

See  https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/blob/master/README.md for examples.
