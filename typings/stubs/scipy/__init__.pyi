SciPy: A scientific computing package for Python
================================================

Documentation is available in the docstrings and
online at https://docs.scipy.org.

Contents
--------
SciPy imports all the functions from the NumPy namespace, and in
addition provides:

Subpackages
-----------
Using any of these subpackages requires an explicit import. For example,
``import scipy.cluster``.

::

 cluster                      --- Vector Quantization / Kmeans
 constants                    --- Physical and mathematical constants and units
 datasets                     --- Dataset methods
 fft                          --- Discrete Fourier transforms
 fftpack                      --- Legacy discrete Fourier transforms

Public API in the main SciPy namespace
--------------------------------------
::

 __version__       --- SciPy version string
 LowLevelCallable  --- Low-level callback function
 show_config       --- Show scipy build configuration
 test              --- Run scipy unittests
