    Saving the state of a dataset records changes that have been made to it.
    This change record is annotated with a user-provided description.
    Optionally, an additional tag, such as a version, can be assigned to the
    saved state. Such tag enables straightforward retrieval of past versions at
    a later point in time.

    .. note::
      Before Git v2.22, any Git repository without an initial commit located
      inside a Dataset is ignored, and content underneath it will be saved to
      the respective superdataset. DataLad datasets always have an initial
      commit, hence are not affected by this behavior.
