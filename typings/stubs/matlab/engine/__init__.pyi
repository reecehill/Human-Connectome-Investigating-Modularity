"""
The MATLAB Engine enables you to call any MATLAB statement either synchronously
or asynchronously.  With synchronous execution, the invocation of a MATLAB
statement returns the result after the call finishes.  With asynchronous
execution, the invocation of a MATLAB statement is performed in the background 
and a FutureResult object is returned immediately.  You can call its "done" 
function to check if the call has finished, and its "result" function to obtain
 the actual result of the MATLAB statement.

This example shows how to call a MATLAB function:

>>> import matlab.engine
>>> eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
>>> eng.sqrt(4.0)
2.0
>>> eng.exit()

    Start the MATLAB Engine.  This function creates an instance of the
    MatlabEngine class.  The local version of MATLAB will be launched
    with the "-nodesktop" argument.

    Please note the invocation of this function is synchronous, which
    means it only returns after MATLAB launches.
    
    Parameters
        option - MATLAB startup option.
        background: bool - start MATLAB asynchronously or not.  This parameter
        is optional and false by default.
                
    Returns
        MatlabEngine - if aync or background is false.  This object can be used to evaluate
        MATLAB statements.
        FutureResult - if async or background is true.  This object can be used to obtain the
        real MatlabEngine instance.

    Raises
        EngineError - if MATLAB can't be started.

    Connect to a shared MATLAB session.  This function creates an instance 
    of the MatlabEngine class and connects it to a MATLAB session. The MATLAB 
    session must be a shared session on the local machine. 

    If name is not specified and there is no shared MATLAB available, this 
    function launches a shared MATLAB session with default options. If name 
    is not specified and there are shared MATLAB sessions available, the first 
    shared MATLAB created is connected.  If name is specified and there are no 
    shared MATLAB sessions with that name, an exception is raised. 

    Parameters 
        name: str - the name of the shared MATLAB session, which is optional.
        By default it is None.
        async, background: bool - connect to the shared MATLAB session asynchronously or
        not.  This is optional and false by default.  "async" is a synonym for 
        "background" that will be removed in a future release.

    Returns
        MatlabEngine - if async or background is false.  This object can be used to evaluate
        MATLAB functions.
        FutureResult - if async or background is true.  This object can be used to obtain the
        real MatlabEngine instance.

    Raises
        EngineError - if the MATLAB cannot be connected.
