    """
    The Eva algorithm extends the Louvain approach in order to deal with the attributes of the nodes (aka Louvain Extended to Vertex Attributes).
    It optimizes - combining them linearly - two quality functions, a structural and a clustering one, namely Newman's modularity and purity, estimated as the product of the frequencies of the most frequent labels carried by the nodes within the communities.
    A parameter alpha tunes the importance of the two functions: an high value of alpha favors the clustering criterion instead of the structural one.
