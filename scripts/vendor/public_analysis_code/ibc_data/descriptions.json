Similarly to some previous tasks, two categories of blocks described the paradigm: (1) the relational-processing block, and (2) the control-matching block. All blocks were constituted by a set of events. In the relational-processing block, visual stimuli consisted of images representing two pairs of objects, in which one pair was placed at the top and the other one at the bottom of the image, respectively. Objects within a pair may differ in two dimensions: shape and texture. The participants had to identify whether the pair of objects from the top differed in a specific dimension and, subsequently, they were asked to determine whether the pair from the bottom changed along the same dimension. For the control block, one pair of objects was displayed at the top of the image and a single object at the bottom of the same image. In addition, a cue was shown in the middle of that image referring to one of the two possible dimensions. The participants had thus to indicate whether the object from the bottom was matching either of the two objects from the top, according to the dimension specified as a cue.

Specifically, the task herein described targeted the same syntactic and semantic modules, but in the context of reading. It thus allowed for capturing further associations with regard to e.g. visual (pseudo) word recognition and sublexical route, among other aspects related to active reading. The paradigm consisted in a block-design presentation strategy of the stimuli. One block was defined as an epoch within a trial and epochs corresponded in turn to experimental conditions. Such conditions stood for the consecutive visual presentation of ten constituents composed by letters. All linguistic content elicited from the conditions except \u201cconsonant strings\u201d, such as grammar rules, lexicon and phonemes, were part of the french language. In order to ensure continuous engagement during task performance, participants were asked, straight afterwards the visualization of every sentence, to ascertain whether the current constituent displayed on the screen, aka \u201cthe probe\u201d, was part of the previous sentence or not. The corresponding answer was provided immediately after the probe, by pressing the button in the left hand if \u201cyes\u201d or the one in the right hand if \u201cno\u201d. Data were collected in six runs during one single session. Every run was composed by sixty trials, in which subsets of ten trials were dedicated to each condition, respectively. The order of the trials was pseudo-randomized within and between runs, such that there were no repeated trials during a full session. Moreover, a different pseudo-randomized order for the presentation of the trials was always employed across participants. One trial comprised several experimental manipulations, other than a block integrating one specific condition. It was sequentially formed by a period of fixation-cross display (two seconds), another short period of a blank screen (0.5 seconds), a block containing the linguistic stimuli (0.4 seconds \u00d7 10 = 4 seconds), a jittered blank screen (varying from one to 1.5 seconds), a period of a second fixation-cross display (0.5 seconds), a period for the probe display (0.5 seconds), and, finally, a response period (varying up to two seconds).

To this end, the inter-stimulus interval was programmed in a sequence of 4, 4, and 6 seconds, meaning that the interval between stimuli would be 4s for the first trial, 4s for the second, 6s for the third, and then the sequence repeats until the end of the run.

For this, the task uses a factorial manipulation of 2 task parameters: search depth and goal hierarchy. Search depth involves mentally constructing the steps necessary to reach the goal state, and the interdependecy between steps in order to do so. This is expressed by the presence or absence of intermediate movements necessary for an optimal solution of each problem. Goal hierarchy refers to whether the order in which the three balls have to be put in their goal positions can be completely extracted from looking at the goal state or if it requires the participant to integrate information between goal and starting states (which result in unambiguous or partially ambiguous goal states, respectively). In each trial, the participant would see two configurations of the towers: the test towers on the left, and the target towers on the right. The towers of the right showed the final configuration of balls required to complete the trial.

The task demands subjects to navigate and orientate themselves in a complex virtual environment. There are three parts of this task: familiarisation (outside of the scanner), encoding (in scanner) and retrieval (in scanner). Before entering the scanner, the participants would do a familiarisation phase where they would be able to freely move through the virtual environment and the objective is to collect eight red balls that can be found in different streets of the virtual city. During this time, the participants can familiarize with the different buildings and their particular features, as well as learning the location of the two key buildings that are indicated at the beginning (Town Hall and Church). After they collect all the red balls, a short training of the main task is performed to ensure the correct understanding of the instructions. The task is comprised by eight runs, from which seven of them (all except the first) starts with an encoding phase. During this period, the participant has to passively watch the camera move from one key building to the other, in such a way that every street of the virtual environment is passed through in every direction possible. Then, after the encoding phase, the retrieval phase is performed. During this part of the experiment, the task is divided in 8 experimental trials and 4 control trials per run. For every trial, the participant appears near an intersection of the virtual environment, which is now covered in a thick fog that prevents them from seeing far ahead. Then, the camera automatically approaches the intersection and stands in the center of it. The task for the participant is to point in the direction of the key building (showed in a miniature picture at the bottom of the screen). Index and middle finger's button of the response box move respectively to the left and right whereas thumb's button validates the answer.

In each trial of a run of this protocol, two unfamiliar and easily discriminable fractal patterns were displayed on a gray background, positioned to the left and right of a central fixation cross. At the beginning of the task, one of these two patterns was arbitrarily designated as \"correct\" and the other as \"incorrect\". Then, the subject's task was to to select one of these two patterns. Selection of the correct pattern led to a monetary gain with a probability of 70% and a monetary loss with a probability of 30%. On the other hand, selection of the incorrect pattern led to a monetary gain with a probability of 30% and a monetary loss with a probability of 70% (reversed gain-loss probability contingencies).

Loss aversion is the phenomenon that suggests that people tend to be more sensitive to losses as compared to equal-sized gains. The study therefore, investigated whether potential losses elicit negative emotions, which then drive loss aversion, or rather the same neural systems, encoding subjective value, asymmetrically respond to losses compared to gains.  In each trial of this protocol, the subjects were presented with a mixed gamble where they had a 50\\% chance of either gaining one amount of symbolic money or losing another amount. The possible gains and losses both ranged between 5-20 units (equal range condition), in increments of 1 unit and all 256 possible combinations of gains and losses were presented to each subject in the same sequence.
